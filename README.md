# My-first-Website

This is the first website I ever created from scratch, for a local kindergarten.

I did this after watching and learning from some tutorials in my spare time for a month. Though I haven't finished the whole tutorial list, the opportunity presented itself for me to take this project, so  I said that I can manage learning whatever I was missing while doing it, and it went all well.
